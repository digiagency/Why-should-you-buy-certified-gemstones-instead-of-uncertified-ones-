# Why-should-you-buy-certified-gemstones-instead-of-uncertified-ones-

Certified gemstones are essential for ensuring authenticity, quality, and astrological effectiveness. Many gemstones in the market are treated, synthetic, or fake, which provide no astrological benefits and may even bring negative effects. A certified gemstone comes with a proper lab report that verifies its origin, purity, and natural properties. Wearing uncertified stones can waste money and also fail to deliver results. Certified gemstones ensure that the stone you wear is genuine, untreated, and aligned with astrological requirements. Moreover, certified gems hold better resale value and long-lasting beauty. Astrologers strongly recommend certified gemstones as they channel planetary energies effectively, ensuring positive outcomes in health, career, and personal life. Buying uncertified gemstones just for low prices can lead to disappointment and even harm. Therefore, always invest in certified stones from trusted dealers for guaranteed results and long-term benefits.
